/** Called when an incoming connection request has been received.  At this point you choose to accept, ignore, or reject the new connection.
 
 When this occurs, you should assign an appropriate TCConnectionDelegate on the TCConnection to properly respond to events.
 
 Pending incoming connections may be received at any time, including while another connection is active.  This method will be invoked once for each connection, and your code should handle this situation appropriately. A single pending connection can be accepted as long as no other connections are active; all other currently pending incoming connections will be automatically rejected by the library until the active connection is terminated.
 
 @param device The TCDevice that is receiving the incoming connection request.
 
 @param connection The TCConnection associated with the incoming connection. The incoming connection will be in the TCConnectionStatusPending state until it is either accepted or disconnected.

/** Called when a presence update notification has been received.
 
 When the device is ready, this selector (if implemented) is invoked once for each available client. Thereafter it is invoked as clients become available or unavailable.
 
 A client is considered available even if another call is in progress.
 
 Remember, when your client disconnects the [TCDeviceDelegate device:didStopListeningForIncomingConnections:] selector will be invoked, and when the device reconnects this presence selector will be called again for every available online client.
