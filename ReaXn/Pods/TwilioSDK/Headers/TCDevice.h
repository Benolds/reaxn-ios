 A TCDevice is the primary entry point for Twilio Client.  An iOS application should initialize a TCDevice with the initWithCapabilityToken:delegate: method with a Capability Token to talk to Twilio services.
 
 A Capability Token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that specifies what the TCDevice may do with respect to the Twilio Application, such as whether it can make outgoing calls, how long the token and the TCDevice are valid before needing to be refreshed, and so on.  Please visit http://www.twilio.com/docs/client/capability-tokens for more information.
