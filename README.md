# #CHIMEHACK 2015: ReaXn
ReaXn enables women to react to dangerous situations in one-step via mobile devices


### Inspiration
Our team identified a common pattern with existing women’s safety apps: excellent features exist for alerts, messages, location tracking and 911 calls - but they all lack quick one-step access to preconfigured actions so that women can react immediately when in danger. That’s where ReaXn comes in.

### How ReaXn works
ReaXn’s iOS prototype allows a user to knock on their phone, without taking it out of their pocket, and send a message alert to anyone. The receiver, content, and other information are pre-configured so reacting is truly a one-step action.

### Challenges
 - Product: Providing tangible value without reinventing the wheel. 
 - Design: Creating a minimal, user-friendly yet eye-catching design. 
 - Engineering: Making texts/calls through Twilio, by-passing the iOS lock screen to enable direct actions when device is knocked on, creating an API for our features.

### What we learned
 - Connect complex global issues with technology and design. 
 - Work in a team, split up tasks, and communicate with people we just met. 
 - Use existing iOS knowledge creatively to provide easy usage.

### What's next for ReaXn
 - Provide more safety features, and more quick-access means 
 - Create an API for iOS and Android for any app to extend our quick-access features.
